# Encrypt-and-Decrypt

Code Written in C and Shell.

Program is created from 5 small programs that encrypt and decrypt information using a one-time pad-like system. The programs will combine the multi-processing code you have been learnign with socket-based inter-process communication.

Plaintext - Information that you wish to encrypt and protect. It is human readable.

Ciphertext - After the plaintext has been encrypted by the programs. Ciphertext is not human-readable, and if the OTP system is used correctly, cannot be cracked.

Key -  A random sequence of characters that will convert Plaintext to Ciphertext, and back again. It cant re-used, or else the encryption is in danger of being broken.
